1555045.0,NIO,Is It Too Late to Buy Nio Stock?,"Sometimes good investment opportunities come for reasons unrelated to the company itself, or even its business sector. China's regulators have come down hard on certain sectors including big tech and for-profit education companies. And recently the fear of loan default by a large Chinese real estate company has shaken markets globally.
In China itself, the turbulence has also hit growing companies that manufacture electric vehicles. Widely followed Chinese EV maker Nio (NYSE: NIO) relies on a manufacturing partnership with a state-owned company. With the government cracking down on business, investors might be wondering if it's too late to profit from this growing sector. But there are several reasons Nio may just be getting started, providing an opportunity for risk-tolerant investors.

Have all the gains been made?
Nio stock peaked in early 2021 with its American depositary shares priced at more than $60, representing a market cap approaching $100 billion. That constituted gains of about 1,500% from January 2020, when the company began to solidify a troubled balance sheet. But the shares have been cut in half since the peak, and with the uncertainty related to U.S.-listed Chinese stocks, some investors might think gains from the stock are in the past.
While the company still isn't profitable, if investors can absorb more macro risks associated with regulators and potential government intervention, there are some bright signs that the business itself is getting ready to take off.
In May 2021, Nio renewed a manufacturing agreement with its state-owned partner through 2024, with plans to double annual capacity to 240,000 vehicles. The company believes demand supports that growth. Nio also has three new products it plans to launch in 2022, including the ET7 luxury electric sedan.
China's market and beyond
The ET7 will be the first sedan offered by Nio, and it is getting closer to mass production. The company recently announced it has completed an extreme-heat test on the sedan, which ""verified the stability of the ET7's thermal management system, performance of the powertrain system, and the battery cooling system under extreme heat conditions.""
Beyond China, Nio plans to launch the ET7 sedan in Norway next year, where it has already sent its first exported shipment of its flagship ES8 SUV from Shanghai. CEO William Li says, ""Our target is to have ET7 in Germany by the end of 2022,"" according to online industry publication InsideEVs. The car was recently shown in Germany along with the Nio EVE, an autonomous-driving concept car that it says was the inspiration for the ET7.
And the automaker isn't just planning to sell vehicles in new markets. The official launch of the ES8 in Norway comes on Sept. 30, with pricing and exact specifications to be announced. Nio Norway general manager Marius Hayler said the company will then open a Nio House on Oct. 1. There are currently 28 Nio Houses across China, which are meant to develop and support the community of its EV users.

Innovating for customers and investors
In addition to the ET7, Nio reportedly plans an ET5 sedan as another new product next year. The vehicle, which will be positioned below the ET7, is expected to be announced at the company's annual Nio Day in 2022, according to Chinese auto industry website autohome.
Innovation isn't restricted to new vehicles, either. The company just announced a new 75 kWh standard-range hybrid-cell battery to replace its 70 kWh version. The company says the new battery, which was developed with patented technologies, has an extended range at cold temperatures. Due to technological efficiencies, the company will offer the new battery at the same price as the previous 70 kWh version. It now is available for new orders along with its longer range 100 kWh battery.
And both come with the option to add a battery-as-a-service subscription, which gives the company another income stream while differentiating itself from competitors. Nio's power solutions service offers chargeable, swappable, and upgradable batteries.
Nio isn't alone in attempting to expand an EV business in the largest global automotive market. And its competitors in China are also growing their businesses outside the country. For investors, risks of owning Nio include competition, political uncertainty, and its status as an as-yet unprofitable company still valued at almost $60 billion. But for aggressive investors with long-term views, who believe in the growth story of the company and the EV sector, it might not be too late to buy Nio.

1498968.0,MT,ArcelorMittal's bid to buy stake in Bosnian iron ore mine rejected,"By Maja Zuvela
SARAJEVO, Jan 30 () - ArcelorMittal's application to bid for the Bosnian government's stake in the Ljubija iron ore mine has been rejected over procedural issues, prompting the world's largest steelmaker to warn of risks to the future of mining in the area.
ArcelorMittal owns a steel plant in the central Bosnian town of Zenica where it processes iron ore from its mines in Prijedor in the north of the country.
ArcelorMittal Group expressed an interest in buying the government's shares through its ArcelorMittal Holdings AG division, 51 percent owner of its local subsidiary ArcelorMittal Prijedor, which has exclusive exploitation rights in the mines under a previous agreement with the government.
The group said it had submitted the necessary documentation, but its nominated company was rejected as a qualified buyer by the region's Investment and Development Bank (IDBRS), which gave no reason for its decision.
""ArcelorMittal is disappointed with today's decision of the IDBRS that jeopardises the long-term future of mining in the Prijedor area,"" the group said in the statement.
An official at IDBRS told ArcelorMittal Holdings AG did not meet the required criteria and that a new auction of the government stake would be announced soon.

7892.0,AAL,"Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL): France Grounds Delta Stock for Now","InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
It is hard to consider the stock market woefully overvalued when there are so many stocks, even sectors, selling at such bargain prices. One such sector is the airlines. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL ) reported announcing earnings this week - $1.5 billion or $1.47 per fully diluted share, beating analyst estimates by 5 cents, on revenue of $10.4 billion - that gave Delta stock a nice bump on Thursday.
Source: via Delta
However, Delta stock was back down in Friday's morning trade, the result of a terrorist attack in Nice, France, that many now fear will cut travel and tourism. It was a full reversal over the previous day's optimism in DAL.
Delta Stock: The Ultimate Fear Value
Fear is the airlines' enemy. Fear of bankruptcy, fear of disruption, fear of unionized employees and competitors benefiting from government support, and of course fear of terrorism.
Right now, this means you can buy Delta stock for less than 7 times earnings. The whole group is in the same doldrums. You can buy Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE: ALK ) for 9.4 times earnings. JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ: JBLU ) is at 8.5 times earnings. Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE: LUV ) - long considered the best-run of the major U.S. carriers, and one that would seemingly be immune to the French concerns given its domestic route structure - is available today for 12.7 times earnings. This in a market where the average P/E is 18.
10 Stocks With More Upside Than Apple Inc. (AAPL)
All the airlines listed in the paragraph above are well-regarded, with good management. Airlines that are not so well-regarded are being treated like wallpaper. American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL ) is selling for 3.2 times earnings. United Continental Holdings Inc. (NYSE: UAL ) is selling at 2.5 times earnings.
These kinds of values are not new. The airlines did get some gains early in the decade, after having gone through a near-death experience in the 2000s that drove most into bankruptcy (including Delta) and from which some, like American and United, are still recovering. But Delta has now been issuing a dividend since 2013, which has more than doubled since then and is now at 14 cents per share, yet since the start of 2015 the shares are actually down, by nearly 20%.
A Long-Term Bull Case
Delta management has been doing all it could against the losing streak. It has kept a good handle on expenses, and is running planes that are, on average, 85% full. Delta recently said it was ahead of schedule on the repurchase of $5 billion in Delta stock, on a $32 billion market cap.
No trend is forever. Everything reverts, in time, to a mean. Delta has been operated well for nearly a decade now, since its merger with Northwest in 2008 made it the world's largest carrier. It is hard for me to see the stock falling far from here, so your risk in owning Delta stock seems minimal.
On the other hand, it's possible I'm trying to argue with myself in this story.
I bought into DAL a year ago for my retirement account and I'm sitting on a loss of 10%, less reinvested dividends. Yet I can't find a reason to pull the trigger and take the loss. I think we're closer to the end of the terrorist threat than the beginning, and once people realize this the airlines are going to fly again.

1944845.0,SBUX,"Starbucks, Undaunted by the Trade War, Sees China Comps Rise 5%","Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) reported a strong fiscal fourth quarter that included growth in its two largest markets. U.S. comparable-store sales gained 6%, while China had 5% comps growth, with a solid increase in transactions of 13%. The overseas strength bucked some negative sentiment toward China since it has showed signs of an economic slowdown as the trade war with the U.S. continues.
Highlights from the fourth quarter
Earnings were strong, and overall guidance suggests fiscal 2020 will be good. But it's worth noting that fiscal 2020 forecasts don't provide a ton of upside over 2019.
Total revenue increased 7% to $6.75 billion year over year. The greatest strength rests within company-operated stores, where revenue grew 8.3%, while licensed locations saw revenue increase by 7.5%.
Total operating income grew 13.2%, while pre-tax income grew 7.7% to $1 billion.
Operating margins improved 90 basis points from last year to 16.1%. Starbucks attributed the improvements to cost savings, sales leverage, and lower restructuring/impairment charges.
Net earnings were $802.9 million, a 6.2% increase.
Earnings broke down to $0.67 per diluted share. That represents a 19.6% increase year over year. Non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings were $0.70 per share, right in line with estimates.
The strength in diluted earnings is related not only to net income growth, but also the continually declining share count. Weighted average shares are down 10.6% from the year-ago quarter.
Guidance and potential
Starbucks provided EPS guidance for fiscal 2020 of $2.84 to $2.89. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings are expected in the range of $3.00 to $3.05. That wouldn't be much growth compared with fiscal 2019's full-year EPS of $2.92. Going off that guidance, shares are trading at a little under 30 times the company's forecast. Starbucks tends to be an expensive stock, but the premium is still something to consider.
Image source: Getty Images
Overall, the fiscal Q4 release closed out the year in style. Transactions in the Americas increased 3% versus a decline of 1% in 2018. The average ticket increased 3%, while overall revenue grew 9% to $4.65 billion. Operating margins did decrease by 70 basis points to 20.2%, but the segment still performed well. International comps grew 3%, while transactions improved by 1% versus a decline of 1% in 2018. Average ticket size increased 3% compared with an increase of 2% the year prior. International revenue gained 6%, while operating margins increased 180 basis points to 16.7%.
The balance sheet is bothersome
I have admittedly been wrong on Starbucks for a while. Weak operating income in the past led me to believe that it was unable to get meaningful value from its overseas expansion. Instead, we're seeing the coffee giant derive growth from China when growth is much slower than in the past. More optimistic views were certainly right. 
My one critique with Starbucks is its balance sheet. For such a well-liked blue chip stock, long-term debt continues to expand, and is now at $11.2 billion at the end of the quarter. The company is running a deficit of $6.23 billion on the balance sheet. This makes continued comps gains a necessity. As someone who really prefers value, I see a problem here. Should things shift, and weaker economic conditions do hit comps, there won't be as much wiggle room for the stock -- especially with its P/E of nearly 30 times forward earnings guidance.

177858.0,AMD,"Intel Corporation Stock Is Massively Overbought, But Should You Sell Now?","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Wow. That's the only word I can think of when I look at the chart of IntelCorporation (NASDAQ: INTC ). The INTC stock price is apparently targeting the moon, as it's been a rocket over the past week.
Source: Shutterstock
The INTC stock price is up 16.5% in the last five trading sessions and now more than 20% over the last month. Does Intel deserve a 30% year-to-date rally or the 40% gain since the beginning of July?
Last week, earnings per share of $1.01 came in ~25% ahead of consensus estimates. Revenue results beat expectations too, although sales grew just 2.3% year-over-year. Full-year guidance was the real driver though, as management now expects earnings of $3.25 per share on revenue of $62 billion. Analysts were looking for $3.01 per share and $61.39 billion, respectively.
The conference call was littered with positive commentary about higher-growth businesses. Reports that Intel might push outQualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) for modem components in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) devices only fueled the positive sentiment. And while all this is great, is the rally really warranted?
INTC Valuation
Analysts, with a new full-year consensus estimate of $62.02 billion in sales, expect revenue growth of 4.3% in 2017. Next year, estimates call for just 2.7% growth. On the earnings front, with one quarter to go, analysts expect 2017 earnings growth of 19.1%. Next year though, those estimates fall to about flat growth.
5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for November
But here's the thing. Intel trades with a forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.5. That's peanuts, really. While Intel isn't growing earnings next year, growth should resume in 2019. As a kicker, INTC stock also pays a 2.4% dividend yield, despite its massive rally over the past few months.
Trading INTC Stock Price
Click to Enlarge
After breaking out over $37, INTC stock has put the pedal to the metal. Now at $47, shares are extremely overbought (see chart above). In fact, I highlighted INTC, along with Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT ), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT ) as some of the most overbought stocks in the entire Dow Jones Industrial Average . In order to buy INTC, we need a pullback. Heck, we at least need INTC to consolidate.
I would look for a decline down to $44-ish. This will mark a 50% retracement from its earnings-fueled breakout. A slew of analysts came out with higher price targets post-earnings, with most targets between $45 and $50. Not to put blind faith in the analysts, but many of these targets were increased after the report. How much upside could realistically be left?
If you're not long, wait for a pullback. If you are long, consider your risk/reward. It might make sense to sell some upside calls. I like Intel very much, but unless earnings growth picks up speed in 2018 and 2019, I wonder how much more investors will pay for INTC stock.
Earnings Implications for Intel
One reason I think INTC stock price is rallying so much is Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ). After AMD's disappointing earnings results in October and Intel's good report, I think many investors sold the former and bought the latter. Essentially, they were plowing their money into the winner and either booking losses or taking gains in AMD (depending on when they bought the stock).
Another driver is Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ). Because of NVDA stock's sky-high valuation, investors in the space are basically left with two choices if they don't want to pay the massive premium: AMD or INTC. As I said above, investors are opting for INTC over AMD. Plus, Nvidia still has earnings on the way in mid-November .
Will the results be good? I'm sure they will. But a slight pullback in the stock would be a better setup than a rally into the results. Intel's results were great and AMD's weren't that bad in my view. If anything, I would think where AMD is seeing a leveling off of demand, Nvidia is picking up that slack. We already know Nintendo Co., Ltd (ADR) (OTCMKTS: NTDOY ) Switch demand is strong, with management hiking its full-year forecast to 14 million units from 10 million.
Strong Earnings Growth Analytics Drive Upgrade of Intel (INTC) to Buy
So long as the chip market remains strong (and it will), NVDA and INTC should have a bid under their stocks. INTC is cheap, but with little growth next year, it's an interesting setup. I would wait for a pullback before buying.

1719171.0,PBA,Pembina Pipeline Closes C$600M Senior Notes Offering - Analyst Blog,"Canadian energy transportation and service provider Pembina Pipeline CorporationPBA has closed the C$600 million senior notes offering announced on Jun 11. The unsecured medium-term notes offering took place in two parts.
The first offering, worth C$500 million, carries an interest rate of 4.24%. These series 6 notes are due to mature on Jun 15, 2027. The second part of the offering - C$100 million - has an interest rate of 4.75% and is part of the company's series 3 notes. These notes are due to mature on Apr 30, 2043.
Pembina Pipeline added that the proceeds from this offering would be used to lower short-term debt under its revolving credit facility. Also, the funds would be used to finance the company's capital programs and for other general corporate purposes.
